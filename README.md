<h4 align="center"> Abstract </h4>

> Information Theory had always been treated as second-class citizen in Black Hole Event Horizon and General Relativity. <br/>
> Not only did our prior contempories failed to investigate "Zero-Mass Information Black Holes", but they also lacked lacuna for implications of such discovery on broader origins of Universe, Multiverse, Space-Time Warp, Wormholes, Media, and Dark Matter. 

<br/>

>  Existence of "Zero Mass Information Black Holes" and consequences of such postulates on Modern Physics will be prophesized here. 

<h4 align="center"> Mathematical Proof for Existence of "Zero Mass Information Black Hole" </h4>

Consider these three axioms in order:
* Radiative falloff behaviour of a massless field at late-times in the background of a topological black hole.
* Homomorphic Topological Spaces.
* An Infinitesimal Point in a Topological Space.
