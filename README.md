<h4 align="center"> Abstract </h4>

> Information Theory had always been treated as second-class citizen in General Theory of Relativity and Black Hole Event Horizon.
> Not only did our prior contempories failed to investigate "Zero-Mass Information Black Holes", but they also lacked lacuna for implications such discovery on broader origins of Universe, Multiverse, Space-Time Warp, Time Travel, Wormholes, and Dark Matter. 

<br/>

>  Existence of "Zero Mass Information Black Holes", and consequences of such postulates, with experimental proofs, on Modern Physics will be delved here.
