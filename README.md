<h4 align="center"> Abstract </h4>

> Information Theory had always been treated as second-class citizen in General Relativity and Black Hole Event Horizon. <br/>
> Not only did our prior contempories failed to investigate "Zero-Mass Information Black Holes", but they also lacked lacuna for implications of such discovery on broader origins of Universe, Multiverse, Space-Time Warp, Wormholes, and Dark Matter. 

<br/>

>  Existence of "Zero Mass Information Black Holes" and consequences of such postulates on Modern Physics will be prophesized.
